Simple string interpolation using OCaml's ppx extension points API.

* How to use

Use like [%str "some string"]. Use $(name) to insert the value of variable
"name" which needs to have type string. Use a double dollar to insert an actual
dollar character.

#+begin_src tuareg
let name = "mario"
print_string [%str "It's a meee, $(name)\n"]
#+end_src

See directory src_test for examples on what to do and not to do.

* How to build

- install OCaml 4.02 or newer
- install opam
- install dependencies
  opam install 

- make all
  
Test by running 'make test'
